## Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) Policy

- We follow an "N-2 policy," supporting at least the current stable Rust release
  and the two preceding versions.
- Our MSRV only advances when we adopt a feature from a newer Rust version. We
  do not increase the MSRV systematically with each new release of Rust.
- MSRV increases are considered regular changes, not breaking changes, in terms
  of Semantic Versioning.
